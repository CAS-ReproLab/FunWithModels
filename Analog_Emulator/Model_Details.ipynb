It involves systematic calculation of voltages at nodes in the circuit using Kirchoff's laws. We begin with [Ohm's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm's_law): \n",

    "MNA described above only returns the distribution of voltages among the nodes at steaty state. To emulate analog computers, we need to model dynamic processes involving changes in voltage and/or current over time. To achieve this we'll add control flow to a new simulation function that enables calculating the MNA distribution for timesteps of a designated size. To solve, we'll use the [backward Euler method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backward_Euler_method). \n",

The characteristic curve is estimated essentially by brute force, using initial values for time and $y(t)$ to sum the current value of the derivative and the product of the derivative with the time step $\\Delta\\,t$. When these are all put together. If plotted, this essentially shows a collection of the tangent lines at every timestep, as the timestep gets smaller, the resolution of the curve becomes more precise, approximating the solution to the differential equation(s). Choosing an appropriate timestep size is important, because it determines the resolution of the solving method. Higher order methods such as the mid-point method are more accurate, but more computationally intensive to solve, so Euler method will work fine here. \n",

    "Forward vs. backward Euler depends on which timepoints are used to find the solution at each step. The backward method is useful here, because we will choose an initial state for the circuit and then 'back-calculate' from each previous step for each present step in time.

Leaky integration presents a distinct challenge for system stability which may be relevant to the description of biological systems. Specifically, the signal dynamics and the RC time constant must be balanced to achieve filtering or integrating effects. If the time constant is too large the signal is integrated too slowly and the input signal must be strong and persist for a long time. If the time constant is too small, the signal leaks away and no integration is performed. This leaky integrator cannot produce an exact solution to the problem, but instead simply slows the dissipation of the input signal.\n",

One possibility is that large numbers and statistical selection aids in determination of the RC time constants that are useful.

Noise in the input creates uncertainty. Noise in the RC time constant feedback and adjustment makes the system able to search for a useful estimate.

    "[Inductors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductance) are devices that stores energy in a magnetic field in order to oppose a change in electic current through the conductor. The simplest versions involve wrapping a wire around a donut shaped magnetic material. When combined with a capacitor this circuit can act as a resonator, storing energy and oscillating at the circuit's [resonant frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance).\n",

    "In this example, we'll build a simple LC circuit. An LC circuit produces oscillations because it stores energy between the magnetic field of the inductor and the electic field of the capacitor.  \n",
